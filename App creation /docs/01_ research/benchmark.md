# Benchmark – Similar Applications and Platforms

## Why this benchmark?
The goal of this benchmark is to look at what already exists around our application idea, **Gamity**.  
We analyzed several platforms used by gamers to:
- find teammates,
- share gaming content,
- help each other with technical or in-game issues.

This helps us understand what works well, what works less well, and most importantly how Gamity can stand out.
