# User Interviews – Needs & Frustrations

## Context
During the product design phase of **Gamity**, we talked with several people who regularly play video games.
The idea was to understand how they usually play, how they find teammates, and what frustrates them the most when playing multiplayer games.

These discussions helped us get real feedback from players, based on their own experiences, habits, and expectations, rather than assumptions.
The interviews focus mainly on team play, communication, and the difficulties of playing with random players.

All interviews follow the same structure and focus on real user experiences.

## Interview Structure

The following questions were asked during each interview:

1. Do you play video games?
2. How often do you play video games and do you mainly play multiplayer or solo games?
3. Do you know any of these platforms: GamerLink, Plink, TeamFinder, GameTree, Discord?
4. Do you regularly look for teammates in video games?
5. When you want to play a team-based game, how do you find teammates?
6. What do you mostly use: friends, Discord, matchmaking?
7. Do you sometimes play with random players? How does it usually go?
8. What is the worst thing about playing with random teammates?
9. Has it ever happened that you didn’t start a game because you had no one to play with?
10. On a scale from 1 to 10, how annoying is it to find good teammates?
11. How often do you encounter toxic, AFK, or non-communicative players?
12. What would make you stop playing with someone after just one game?

## Key Insights from Interviews

From these interviews, several common points clearly appear:

- Finding reliable teammates is difficult and frustrating
- Toxic behavior and lack of communication are major issues
- Many players rely on solo queue or Discord, even if they are not fully satisfied

- Not having teammates can prevent players from even starting a game

These insights strongly support the need for a platform like **Gamity**, focused on trust, community, and better player matching.
