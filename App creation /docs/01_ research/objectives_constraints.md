# Objectives, Assumptions, Risks and Constraints

## Objectives

The main goal of Gamity is not to compete with big platforms like Discord, but to address a clear problem: helping gamers find reliable teammates in a way that is simple, fast, and community-driven.

Based on user interviews and benchmark research, Gamity focuses on:
- Helping players find teammates based on games, skill level, and availability.
- Reducing frustration from solo queue or random matchmaking.
- Allowing players to briefly interact before playing together via a temporary text chat.
- Giving players a space to share gaming moments and short clips to foster community engagement.

Gamity is a **connection and discovery tool**, not a messaging or voice platform.

### Measurable objectives (MVP)
- Users can create a gamer profile with basic information (games, level, availability).
- Users can post an announcement to look for teammates for a specific game.
- Other users can respond to the announcement with a “Play together” action.
- Once matched, users are placed in a **private text chat** to coordinate and exchange contact information (Discord, phone, etc.).
- The main flow (post → match → chat) can be completed without friction.
- Users can post and view short clips or posts related to gaming.

## Assumptions

Based on interviews and benchmark findings:
- Many gamers struggle to find compatible teammates and often encounter toxic or non-communicative players.
- Players are not necessarily looking for a full platform replacement; they just want a simple and reliable way to meet teammates.
- Short text interaction is usually enough for players to decide whether to team up.
- Discord and other communication tools are already widely used, and players are willing to switch to them for in-game voice.
- Community features (posts, clips) increase user engagement and retention.

---

## Risks

Potential challenges include:
- Users may expect full messaging or voice chat features and be disappointed by the text-only private chat.
- Users might leave immediately after exchanging external contacts, limiting retention.
- The platform relies on having enough active users simultaneously for matchmaking to work.
- Toxic or inappropriate behavior could occur in private chats without proper moderation.
- Users may have trust issues when contacting strangers through a new platform.
- Overloading features could make the app confusing or reduce adoption.

These risks underline the need for a **focused MVP** and clear communication about the platform’s purpose.

## Constraints

The project is built under several constraints:
- Limited development resources and time for the MVP.
- Web-based MVP only; no full mobile app at this stage.
- Gamity provides **text-only temporary chat** for matchmaking and contact exchange.
- Voice or long-term messaging is explicitly **out of scope**; external tools like Discord are expected for those needs.
- Core features must remain simple: profile, announcement, matching, private chat, and content sharing.
- Focus on reliability, trust, and usability, not on trying to compete with existing major platforms.

Gamity is intentionally **complementary**: it connects gamers efficiently and lets them decide how and where to communicate for the actual game.
