# Problem Statement

Many multiplayer gamers struggle to find reliable and compatible teammates. Most existing solutions rely on solo matchmaking, friends, or large communication platforms, which often result in poor communication, toxic behavior, and unbalanced teams.

This makes playing team-based games frustrating rather than enjoyable. Some players avoid certain games altogether or stop playing earlier than they want because they do not have trustworthy teammates to play with.

At the same time, there is no simple and dedicated platform that allows players to both find teammates and interact positively through content sharing or mutual help.

The core problem is the lack of a focused, trusted, and community-driven space that supports team play and meaningful social interaction for gamers.
