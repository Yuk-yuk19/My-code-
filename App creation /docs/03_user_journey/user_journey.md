# User Journey – Main Usage Scenario

## Scenario Overview
This user journey describes the main and most common usage scenario for **Gamity**: a gamer who wants to find a teammate for a multiplayer game and quickly decide whether to play together.

---

## Step 1 – First launch and account creation

The user downloads the application and opens it for the first time.  
They are asked to create an account by entering basic information such as a username and the games they play.

**Friction points**
- Users may not want to spend too much time creating an account.
- Too many required fields could discourage first-time users.

**Opportunities**
- Keep account creation short and simple.
- Focus only on information that helps matchmaking (games, level, availability).

---

## Step 2 – Discovering the feed and community content

Once the account is created, the user arrives on the main feed.  
They can browse clips shared by other players.
Then the user would be able to comment and potentialy upvote the clip or a comment for other users to see. 

**Friction points**
- New users may not immediately understand what they can do.
- Too much content could feel overwhelming.

**Opportunities**
- Clear visual cues and simple actions.
- Use popular or relevant posts to encourage interaction.

---
## Step 3 – Use The Community Forum 

Users may as well help or ask for help to other users by using the forum.
Then can either add a question to the forum in which other users will be able to respond. 

---

## Step 4 – Searching for teammates

If the user wants to play, they can either:
- create a new listing to look for teammates, or
- browse existing listings posted by other players.

They can apply filters such as:
- game,
- ranked or unranked mode,
- skill level or ranking,
- availability.

**Friction points**
- Not enough active listings at certain times.
- Filters that are too complex or unclear.

**Opportunities**
- Highlight active or recent listings.
- Keep filters limited to what really matters for players.

---

## Step 5 – Matching with another player

When a user finds a listing that matches their expectations, they can click on a “JOIN” button.  
If both users agree, they are matched.

**Friction points**
- Fear of playing with unknown players.
- Doubts about compatibility or communication.

**Opportunities**
- Show basic profile information before matching.
- Encourage respectful and clear interactions.

---

## Step 6 – Private text chat

Once matched, both users are placed in a private text chat.  
This chat is used only to:
- briefly talk,
- ask questions,
- and exchange contact details (Discord, phone number, etc.).

Gamity does not provide voice chat.

**Friction points**
- Users may expect voice or long-term messaging features.
- Short conversations may feel limiting.

**Opportunities**
- Make the purpose of the chat very clear.
- Encourage users to move to their preferred platform once ready to play.

---

## Step 7 – Playing together (outside Gamity)

After exchanging contact details, users move to an external platform (usually Discord) to communicate by voice and play together.

At this point, Gamity has fulfilled its main role: connecting compatible players.

**Friction points**
- Users may not return to the app after playing.

**Opportunities**
- Encourage users to come back to share clips or feedback.
- Use community content to increase long-term engagement.

---

## Summary

This journey highlights how Gamity fits into the existing habits of gamers instead of trying to replace them.
By focusing on matchmaking, short interaction, and community content, Gamity reduces frustration while staying simple and realistic within the MVP scope.
