## 1. Community Chat

### Description
The forum screen represents the main discussion space of the application. It displays a list of forum threads where users can ask questions, share information, and respond to other members. Each thread card includes the author’s avatar, the title or author name, and the date of the last activity, allowing users to quickly identify active and relevant discussions.

The screen is designed to encourage participation while making it easy to browse ongoing topics and return to previously viewed threads.

### Design Rationale
A vertical list layout was chosen to prioritize readability and content scanning, which is essential in a question-and-answer oriented forum. This structure allows users to quickly assess multiple discussions without cognitive overload.  
The consistent card design helps establish a clear visual rhythm, making each thread easy to distinguish while maintaining overall interface coherence.

Primary information is placed at the top of each card to guide the user’s attention, while secondary details such as dates are visually de-emphasized. The fixed bottom navigation bar ensures that users can easily switch between sections of the application without losing their place in the forum, supporting smooth and continuous navigation.

## 2. User Profile Screen

### Description
The profile screen focuses on presenting the user’s identity and shared content. The profile picture and username are centered at the top of the screen, followed by an “Edit profile” button. Below this section, user content is displayed in a grid format, showcasing shared game-related media.

### Design Rationale
The centered positioning of the profile information emphasizes the user’s identity and creates a balanced visual composition. The edit profile button is placed directly under the username to make account customization easy to find and access.  
The grid layout for content was selected because it allows efficient use of screen space while remaining visually structured, a pattern commonly adopted in social platforms and therefore familiar to most users.

### Description
This screen enables users to explore and join different game communities. Each community is presented as a large card containing a visual banner, the game name, and a “Join” button. Additional indicators provide information about community activity.

### Design Rationale
Large horizontal cards were chosen to enhance readability and touch accuracy on mobile devices. The use of game-specific visuals helps users quickly recognize the communities they are interested in.  
The “Join” button is positioned on the right side of each card, following common interaction patterns and making the primary action immediately visible. Its green color was selected to clearly communicate a positive and actionable choice.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility was considered throughout the design process to ensure inclusivity and ease of use. High contrast between text and background improves readability for users with visual impairments. Buttons and interactive elements were designed with sufficient size to facilitate comfortable touch interactions.  
The interface follows a simple and consistent navigation structure, limiting cognitive load and helping users understand the application more easily. Consistent icon usage across screens further supports recognition and usability for all users.
