# Test Protocol

## Tester Instructions

Testers were asked to interact with the clickable prototype in order to evaluate the clarity, usability, and coherence of the interface.  
They were instructed to navigate through the main screens, use the available interactive elements (such as buttons and menus), and follow the primary user flow as intended by the design.

During the test, users were encouraged to:
- Explore the interface freely.
- Complete typical user actions (e.g., navigating between sections, opening menus or overlays).
- Identify any usability issues, unclear interactions, or navigation difficulties.

Feedback focused on ease of use, understanding of the interface, and overall user experience.
