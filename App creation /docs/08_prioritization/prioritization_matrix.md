# Prioritization Matrix

## Method Used: MoSCoW

This prioritization is defined from an external, functional point of view, while staying closely aligned with the **main purpose of the application: helping users find teammates easily**.  
Each item focuses on what is necessary for this core use case and remains realistic for a prototype.

## MoSCoW Matrix

### Must Have

- **Functional navigation between main screens**  
  Users must be able to move between sections (home, search, forum, profile) to understand and use the application.

- **Clear access to the main content**  
  The core information must be immediately visible so users can quickly understand what the app offers.

- **Ability to find teammates through posts or listings**  
  This is the main purpose of the application: users need to be able to view teammate requests or search for people to join a team.

---

### Should Have

- **Consistent layout across all screens**  
  A consistent structure helps users focus on finding teammates instead of learning how the interface works.

- **Clear distinction between primary and secondary actions**  
  Important actions (e.g. “Find a team”, “Post a request”) should stand out to guide user behavior.

- **Clear entry point to create a teammate request**  
  Users should easily understand how to post a request if they are looking for teammates.

---

### Could Have

- **Smooth transitions between screens**  
  These improve the overall experience but are not required to complete the main task.

- **Minor visual refinements (spacing and alignment)**  
  These changes increase comfort and readability without affecting the ability to find teammates.

- **Basic filters (e.g. game, role, availability)**  
  Helpful for refining searches, but not strictly necessary for demonstrating the concept.

---

### Won’t Have (This Version)

- **Additional features outside the core scope**  
  These could distract from the main goal of finding teammates.

- **Backend or advanced system logic**  
  Not required at the prototype stage, where interaction and structure are the focus.

- **Advanced matching or recommendation system**  
  While important in the long term, this feature is too complex for the current version.

---

## Overall Justification

This prioritization ensures that the application clearly supports its **core use case: finding teammates**, while remaining simple and achievable at the prototype level.  
Essential interactions are prioritized first, followed by usability improvements and optional enhancements for future iterations.
